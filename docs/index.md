# Welcome to the data science quickstart!
 By the end of this mini series you should understand the basic terminoligy surrounding data science/data mining and machine learning!

# Prerequisites
For new users, I *highly recommend* [installing Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

Download [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). We recommend downloading Anacondaâ€™s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.5).

Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:

jupyter notebook
See [Running the Notebook](Running the Notebook) for more details.
